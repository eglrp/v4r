UREAD/UWRITE are like FREAD/FWRITE except that they operate on arrays
in memory.

A=UWRITE(D, PREC) will create a uint8 array A from the double array D.
The format of the binary data in A is determined by PREC (one of
uint8, uint16, uint32, int8 int16, int32, float32, float64, or
double).  The size of A is dependent on the precision PREC.

D=UREAD(A, N, PREC) will read the uint8 array A and return N values
into D.  The data in A are assumed to be in the format of PREC (see
UWRITE for supported formats).

Installation:

1. Install the files, creating directory ``uwrite'':
	gunzip -c uwrite.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

2. Add the directory to your matlab path:
	path(path, '<directory>/uwrite');

3. Set up the MEX compiler following the instructions supplied by
   Mathworks:
	mex -setup

4. Compile the C files:
	cd <directory>/uwrite
	mex uread.c
	mex uwrite.c

Usage:

1. Add the directory to your matlab path:
	path(path, '<directory>/uwrite');

2. ``help uread'' and ``help uwrite'' will give instructions.  Also
   look at the source  code in uread.c and uwrite.c

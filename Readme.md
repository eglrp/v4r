[![build status](https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/v4r/v4r/badges/master/build.svg)](https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/v4r/v4r/commits/master)

The V4R library is an open source project from the [Vision4Robotics (V4R)](http://v4r.acin.tuwien.ac.at) group at the ACIN institute, TU Vienna. It contains various state-of-the-art Computer Vision methods and applications especially designed for 3D point cloud processing with a strong focus on robotics applications.

# Dependencies:

V4R is stronlgy based on RGB-D data and uses [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)  and [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) to process data. Here is a list of **required** components:

| Name | Version | Licence |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)  | 2.4+  or 3.x | 3-clause BSD |
| [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)  | 3+ | MPL2 |
| [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)  | 1.48+ | Boost Software License |
| [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/)  | 1.7.2 or 1.8.x | BSD |

| [CMake](https://cmake.org)  | 3.5.1+ | 3-clause BSD |

This is a list of **optional** components:

| Name | Version | Licence |  required[*r*] or optionally-used[*o*] by following V4R modules | Comments |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|-----:|-----:|

| [MVS-Texturing](https://github.com/nmoehrle/mvs-texturing)\*  |  |  BSD | RTMT2[*r*], surface[*r*]| creates textured surfaces for object models |

\* these libraries will be installed automatically during V4R's build process (either by downloading source code from a given URL or by using code copies inside V4R)

The library itself is independent of any robot operating system such as ROS. To use it inside ROS, you can find wrappers in a separate [V4R ROS  wrappers repository](https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/v4r/v4r_ros_wrappers), which can be placed inside the normal catkin workspace.

# Installation:

## From Ubuntu Package

First enable the V4R apt repositories (xenial only for now) with the following commands.

 * Add the following line to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` file or in a new file (eg. `v4r.list`) in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`  directory.
 `deb [arch=amd64] https://rwiki.acin.tuwien.ac.at/apt/v4r-release xenial main`

* Add the gpg key I used to sign the release to your keyring
`wget -qO - https://rwiki.acin.tuwien.ac.at/apt/v4r-release/Public.key | sudo apt-key add -`

* Update and install
`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install v4r`

## From Source

```
cd ~/somewhere
git clone 'https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/v4r/v4r.git'
cd v4r
./setup.sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install #optional
```

## ROS Interfaces

In order to use V4R in ROS, use the [v4r_ros_wrappers](https://rgit.acin.tuwien.ac.at/v4r/v4r_ros_wrappers).

## Notes

### Caffe

If you want to use CNN feature extraction, you need to install the Caffe library. We recommend to use CMake-based installation for Caffe and provide the install folder to V4R's cmake call as

```
cmake .. -DCaffe_DIR=/your_caffe_ws/build/install/share/Caffe
```
